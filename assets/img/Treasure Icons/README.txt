I used Clint Bellanger's Wooden Stick and Spellbook icons from Heroine Dusk and collected a few more icons based on their concepts and art style. The keys and the wooden planks are by me, and the rest are carefully re-colored icons from other artists. Most of the icons represent items that can interact with First Person Dungeon Crawl tiles. 

Keys: open locked doors and chests

Bow & Arrow: snipe a lurking dragon

Shovel: dig up a grass tile

Axe: chop a tree

Iron Ring: get into the secret meeting

Gauntlet of Strength: push heavy objects

Wood Planks: bridge a gap or float on water

Bomb: break destructable tiles

Copper Spyglass: see tiles further ahead than normal

Silver Mirror: reflect light at a target or see the tiles behind you

Wood Shield: deflect thrown rocks and walk sideways

Braided Whip: bring objects closer or swing across a gap

Writ of Passage: access a guarded bridge

Other icons are included to facilitate quests or game mechanics. Eat bread and nuts for energy and strength. The mushroom and the clover are supposed to have magical qualities. Store liquid in a bottle or flask, and collect other things in the pouch.

If you need more, PriorBlue has recolored a ton of icons using the DawnBringer palette. Most of these make full use of the palette and use more than 4 colors per icon. see https://opengameart.org/content/recolor-all-the-items
